The current company process is inefficient, time-consuming, and costly because it has no automated system to handle the entire process in an efficient manner. 

The following reasons have mainly affected to automate the company processes.​

* Trainees can’t track their progress.​
* A way to manage the clients
* An efficient method to manage the tasks of the executive board
* An efficient work allocation was required.​
* A proper way to manage the inventory
* The manual system (paper-based) was needed to be computerized.​
*  A modernized method to mark the attendance was needed
* An easy way to notify company notices

Thus, our proposed web system is infused with the current technology which solves most of the difficulties of the existing management system of the company.
